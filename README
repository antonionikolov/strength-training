Strength Training

This is Ruby project, which helps you to follow your strenght training progress.
You insert data into the database every time you train and that helps you to
realize your potential. You can see how much weight you have been lifting on
certain date. You can see your training program all time record or your one rep
all time record. You can see your progress in weight you lift. There are also
charts which visualize your progress from date to date. With this you can follow
your squat, deadlift, bench press, shoulder press and pull ups. That is what it
is made for - to follow your base exercises which helps you to grow stronger.
The programs which are more appropriate are from 1 to 5 reps and from 5 to 10
series.
